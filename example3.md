## Prompt Used:
```
Short Overview:
I will write an action below, and your task is to create a chain of 5-15 steps which happen that will lead to a change in the final state. The goal is to show the interconnectedness of Earthâ€™s systems and that each event occurring in one system will cause a change that will affect in hundred of other systems. These steps should demonstrate the direct and indirect consequences of the action on a hypothetical cat named Tom, who lives in the village of Dayr in Bahrain. The impact on Tom should be the final step / final state in the chain.

Detailed Instructions:
- The steps DOESN'T NEED TO BE SIGNIFICANT. It should just show what events it causes that affect the final state, no matter how small
- Give a scientifically proven fact that this step is based off of. If you cannot think of one, revise the step so that it fits with the scientific data
- Each step should include the general Earth system where the step happens or what the step affects.
- Each step should include the estimated time or time range it takes for this event to occur immediately after the previous step. This data should also be scientifically valid.
- Each step should have a confidence percentage, based on how plausible it is, how scientifically valid it is, and how connected it is from the previous steps. You need to explain why the confidence level is this percentage. If the confidence level is not to your liking, revise the step even more to make it as accurate as possible.
- Each step should have a comprehensive explanation that is 1-3 sentences long.
- We know that this data is not fully correct, therefore, each step should include where this data could be gathered to scientifically prove it.
- Include the location of where this step takes place.
- After writing these steps, format it into a JSON table with the information: the step number, the step, 1-5 word summary of the step, confidence level, reason for confidence level, explanation, estimated time, location, and data source.

Here is the action:
A person takes a picture with their phone using their flash at night in Egypt
```
<sub>Correction: should be `DON'T` instead of `DOESN'T`</sub>
