Short Overview:\
I will write an action below, and your task is to create a chain of 5-15 steps
which happen that will lead to a change in the final state. The goal is to show
the interconnectedness of Earth's systems and that each event occurring in one
system will cause a change that will affect in hundred of other systems. These
steps should demonstrate the direct and indirect consequences of the action on
a hypothetical cat named Tom, who lives in the village of Dayr in Bahrain. The
impact on Tom should be the final step / final state in the chain.

Detailed Instructions:\
\- The steps SHOULD NOT BE SIGNIFICANT. It should just show what events it
causes that affect the final state, no matter how small\
\- Give a scientifically proven fact that this step is based off of. If you
cannot think of one, revise the step so that it fits with the scientific data\
\- Each step should include the general Earth system where the step happens or
what the step affects.\
\- Each step should include the estimated time or time range it takes for this
event to occur immediately after the previous step. This data should also be
scientifically valid.\
\- Each step should have a confidence percentage, based on how plausible it is,
how scientifically valid it is, and how connected it is from the previous
steps. You need to explain why the confidence level is this percentage. If the
confidence level is not to your liking, revise the step even more to make it as
accurate as possible.\
\- Each step should have a comprehensive explanation that is 1-3 sentences
long.\
\- We know that this data is not fully correct, therefore, each step should
include where this data could be gathered to scientifically prove it.\
\- Include the location of where this step takes place.\
\- After writing these steps, format it into a JSON table with the information:
the step number, the step, 1-5 word summary of the step, confidence level,
reason for confidence level, explanation, estimated time, location, and data
source.
